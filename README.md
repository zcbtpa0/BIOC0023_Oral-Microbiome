# BIOC0023_Oral-Microbiome
Presented here are all the codes that were run for analysing the oral microbiome of two individuals. 
9 reads for each individual were carried out: 3 before, 3 during and 3 after teeth whitening treatment. 
All tests were conducted to fulfil the aim of investigating the effect of teeth whitening treatment such as charcoal polish on oral microbiome, especially the abundance of Streptococcus.
